# - Modeling and Optimizing a Battery Charging Profile -
# Project Description

This project models the charging behavior of a Panasonic NCA103450 lithium-ion battery using a first-order RC (resistor-capacitor) circuit approximation. Using MATLAB, we fit a voltage curve based on the battery's specifications, compute the total energy delivered via integration, and analyze key performance metrics like the rate of voltage change, time to charge, and energy lost to heat. The analysis is extended to compare a simple Constant Voltage (CV) charging model with the more common and efficient Constant Current-Constant Voltage (CC-CV) method.

# Methods & Results

The battery is modeled as a capacitor in series with a resistor. The core parameters, internal resistance (R) and equivalent capacitance (C), were derived from the battery's spec sheet, which specifies a 4-hour charge time. Assuming R = 0.25 Î©, the capacitance was calculated to be C = 11338 F to align with a realistic CC-CV charging profile starting from 3.2V.

The model was implemented in MATLAB through a series of modular functions that calculate voltage, current, power, and energy over time. The primary driver scripts, BatteryModel.m and CompareChargingMethods.m, execute the simulation and generate the analysis and plots.

The key results of the comparison show that the CC-CV charging method is significantly faster than a simple CV method. The simulation, which aligns with the manufacturer's data, shows the battery reaching a full charge (defined by a 45mA cut-off current) in approximately 4.02 hours.

# How to Run the Model

    Ensure all folders and files are in the same MATLAB path. If MATLAB prompts you to "Add to Path," click the button to do so.

    To run the basic CV model analysis, execute main/BatteryModel.m. This will generate three plots and display the energy, efficiency, and charge time calculations in the command window.

    To run the comparison between charging methods, execute main/CompareChargingMethods.m. This will generate two plots comparing the voltage and current profiles and print the final charge time for the CC-CV method.
